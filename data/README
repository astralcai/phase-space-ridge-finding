Simulation is of a system of test particles in the background
potential of an axisymmetric Milky Way like galaxy. The test particles
all have the same angular momentum, which is set so that their guiding
radius is at R_circ = 8 kpc. Since the particles have some radial
velocity, and are therefore not on perfect circular orbits, the
particles fill out a ring in the xy plane, centred on R=8 kpc.

The ring is given a small, axisymmetric perturbation and then allowed
to evolve. Thus, the phase space is 4 dimensional, since V_phi is 
determined from the radius R and the angular momentum (which is the 
same for each particle) and the system is independent of phi. We thus
write the phase space coordinates as (z,R,vR,vz).

4DPhaseSpace.ipynb makes nice corner plots of the 4D phase space for a
simulation snapshot.

P_DeltaRc.bin P_DeltaRc.0250, .0500, .0750, .1000 are initial conditions
and the snapshots at 250Myr, 500Myr, 750Myr, and 1Gyr respectively.

Snapshots are in binary form. To convert to .ascii, run the reverter.c code

./reverter P_DeltaRc.bin P_DeltaRc.info P_DeltaRc.ascii

etc.
